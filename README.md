## Ember(user) begins with 4000 health points and Roshan(computer) starts with 10000 health points.
### This game is played by the user selecting the order of one of two options:
    1. The user can select either Physical Attack for a consistent 800 damage to Roshan
        or Magical Attack damage that has a variable rate between 0-2000.
    2.Roshan has similar abilities that the user will not see but will conduct its damage by attacking you once with its
        physical attack that does a consistent $400 and then a Magi attack damage that has a variable rate of damage as well ranging between 0-800.
